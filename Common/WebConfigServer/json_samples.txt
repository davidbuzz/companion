Messages initiated on the "Buzz Linux Gateway", and Sent *to* the PORTAL instance expect a response ( coming back to "Buzz") containing "status": "OK".

Messages initiated on the PORTAL instance and Sent *to* the "Buzz Linux Gateway", expect a response ( coming back to "PORTAL") containing 
a variant of the original packet which contains a modified list of MAC address/s, and this: "response": "...some...string...here...", or sometimes no response at all. 


OUTBOUND REQUEST  FROM "BUZZ" TO PORTAL: 
{
  "DeviceUpdate": {
    "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff": {
      "BatteryLevel": 3.6,
      "Temperature": 30,
      "RSSI": 1,
      "FirmwareVersion": "3.2.4",
      "NewDeviceStatus": "0",
      "LastDeviceSeenDateTime": 1465791665,
      "text1": "",
      "text2": ""
    },
    "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ee": {
      "BatteryLevel": 3.1,
      "Temperature": 20,
      "RSSI": 0.9,
      "FirmwareVersion": "3.2.1",

      "text1": "",
      "text2": ""
    },
    "dd:ee:aa:dd:bb:ee": {
      "BatteryLevel": 3.1,

}
WITH RESPONSE, when it is accepted:
{
  "status": "OK"
}
Any string above except from 'OK' is considered a failure.
this similar response is also acceptable as it contains "status": "OK" in the JSON at the top level:
{
  "status": "OK",
  "BlahBLahBLah": "99",
  "some arbitrary info": "1234"
}

OUTBOUND REQUEST FROM "BUZZ" TO PORTAL: 
{
    "DeviceChange": {
      "eb:4f:80:b6:6a:e7": {
        "BatteryLevel": "f4 0f", 
        "FirmwareVersion": "0.9.9", 
        "LastDeviceSeenDateTime": 1466403342, 
        "LastRead": "00 00 00", 
        "NodeID": "01", 
        "NewDeviceStatus": 2, 
        "RSSI": 1.0, 
        "Temperature": 18
      }
    }
}
WITH RESPONSE, when it is accepted:
{
  "status": "OK"
}
or in some cases:
{ 
	 "status": "OK",
	 "AcknowledgedDeviceStatus": {
		"eb:4f:80:b6:6a:e7": {
			"NodeID": "01", 
			"NewDeviceStatus": 2, 
			...etc...       (as per the incoming request, there needs to be at least NodeID, NewDeviceStatus that matched the request) 
		}
	 }
}
TIP: Including the "AcknowledgedDeviceStatus" stanza, with "MAC", "NodeID" and "AcknowledgedDeviceStatus" in the above response is mandatory for a 
response only if any of the "NewDeviceStatus" values in the request is 2 or 4, and should contain the same data as in 
the request.    ie "NewDeviceStatus": 2  -->  "AcknowledgedDeviceStatus": 2 , etc..   
( the MAC and NodeID should simply be copied directly from the incoming packet) 
It is this Acknowledgement with the "AcknowledgedDeviceStatus" that affirms all the way back to the Serial Node that 
the "Server" ( ie PORTAL ) has seen the "Swipe"  ( status change ) properly.
